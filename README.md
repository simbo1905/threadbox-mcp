# Snake Game (Flutter Desktop)

Classic Snake arcade experience built with Flutter and tuned for Linux desktop play. Steer the snake with your keyboard (or on-screen controls), eat the food to grow, and chase a new high score.

## Features

- Responsive board that scales to the current window size
- Keyboard controls (WASD / arrow keys) with optional on-screen directional pad
- Pause / resume and instant restart support
- High-score tracking for the current session
- Material 3 theme with subtle desktop-friendly styling

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK (3.22 or newer recommended)
- Linux desktop tooling enabled (`flutter config --enable-linux-desktop`)
- A Linux device with GTK 3 development libraries (install via your distro package manager)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate into the project
cd /workspace

# Fetch packages
flutter pub get

# Ensure desktop support (only needs to be run once per machine)
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

# If the linux runner folder is missing, let Flutter scaffold it
flutter create . --platforms=linux

# Launch the game
flutter run -d linux
```

> **Tip:** Use `flutter build linux` to produce a distributable bundle once you're happy with the game.

## Gameplay Controls

- `Arrow Keys` / `WASD`: Move the snake
- `Space`: Pause or resume
- `Enter`: Restart after game over
- UI buttons: Alternative controls for direction, pause, and restart

## Project Structure

- `lib/main.dart`: Complete game implementation (UI, game loop, rendering)
- `pubspec.yaml`: Flutter project configuration and dependencies
- `linux/`: Native runner (auto-generated by `flutter create --platforms=linux`; can be regenerated safely)
